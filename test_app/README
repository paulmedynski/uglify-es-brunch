This is a test application used to manually verify the uglify-es-brunch
plugin using a real brunch build environment.  It builds some sample
files found in the app/ directory and optimizes them using whatever version
of uglify-es has been installed.

The package.json in this directory directs Node to use the uglify-es-brunch
module found in the parent directory via the file-based dependency mechanism.
This sets up a symlink from this app's node_modules/ to the parent directory,
so you can make changes to uglify-es-brunch, and the next build here will use
them.

Helpful commands:

npm install

  Fetch all of this app's dependent modules and put them into
  node_modules/.

npm install uglify-es@3.y.z

  Install whatever version of uglify-es you want to test with.  By default,
  the npm install step will install the latest v3 version.

./uglify-es -V

  Confirm that you're using the version of uglify-es that you think you are.

export NODE_PATH=node_modules/

  Adds this test app's node_modules/ to node's resolver.  This is necessary
  because Node will resolve the symlink to uglify-es-brunch to an absolute
  path, and then only search that path for uglify-es.  However, uglify-es
  isn't installed by uglify-es-brunch - it's only a peer dependency.  In
  order for Node to find the uglify-es installed into this app's
  node_modules/, we must explicitly add that path to Node's module search
  path.
  
./brunch build -d -p

  Build the test app.  This tests uglify-es-brunch.  The build result goes
  into the public/app.js.

The uglify-es-brunch package.json specifies typescript as a peer dependency,
so you should never see an uglify-es directory inside uglify-es-brunch's
node_modules/.  If you do, you've done something wrong and should nuke this
app's entire node_modules/, and ulgify-es-brunch's node_modules/ and npm
install them again.

The test app has been tested with the following uglify-es versions:

  3.3.9

It has also been tested with these node versions:

  11.0.0
  10.13.0
  8.12.0
